# Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making-Tool
The proposed multi-criteria evaluation approach enables utilities to conduct a comprehensive assessment based on their objectives, budget, available resources and team capability, thereby facilitating evidence-based and more informed decision-making. Significant criteria of interest are identified and scored within each scenario, and then weighted accordingly to rank the two alternatives (i.e., the liquid-based method and the gas-based method).
